# Seshtype base lib

To create a new Seshtype in the pixelthump framework you will need to einter use this dependency or implement everything by hand (using this is way easier so do it)

Add this to you POM.xml and implement all the Interfaces int the service package that don't already have an implementation. 
Add a config that extends uppon the auto config to pull it into your project (Will be done differently in the future once i know how).
And then you're basicly done. Add some config parameters and e'voila You made your own backend service for your sehstype. Now you just need someone (you yourself) to do the frontend part.
